title: "Using gganimate to map NEET patterns in England"

I have been playing around with the newly revamped [gganimate package](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate) recently. I've found it so intuitive, especially having used d3 before. You can really make some amazing graphs by utilising only a few lines of extra code.

For example: below is the full code (including cleaning/transformation) I used to create a gif of the numbers of young people in England aged 16-24 who were not in employment, education or training (NEET) between 2000 and 2017. I made use of the new gganimate function `transition_reveal`, which allowed me to slowly transition the `geom_line` along the `Date` variable.

```
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(rehsape2)

##Read in the data

mydata <- read_xls("~/Downloads/neets-borough-region.xls", sheet=3)

##Rename/reshape the data properly

mydata <- mydata[1:11, ]
mydata[1,1] <- "Region"
colnames(mydata) <- mydata[1, ]
mydata <- mydata[2:11, ]

##Reshape - wide to long
##Change Q1:4 to dates

mydata <- mydata %>%
  reshape2:: melt(id.vars="Region") %>%
  mutate(Year = str_sub(variable, 1, 4)) %>%
  mutate(Date = case_when(
    str_detect(variable, "Q1") ~ paste0("01/01/",Year),
    str_detect(variable, "Q2")  ~ paste0("01/04/",Year),
    str_detect(variable, "Q3") ~ paste0("01/07/",Year),
    str_detect(variable,"Q4") ~ paste0("01/10/",Year),
    TRUE ~ "0")) %>%
  select(-Year, -variable) %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format="%d/%m/%Y")) %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) %>%
  filter(Region=="England") %>%
  mutate(value = value/1000)

##Plot 

ggplot(mydata, aes(x=Date, y=value, group=1)) +
  geom_line(color="steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  transition_reveal(Date, along=Date) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("No. (000s)") +
  labs(caption = "Source: Department for Education")
```

Only 1 extra line of code! And the finished product:
